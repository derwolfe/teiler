"""
This module is resposible for peer discovery over UDP only.

The process is simple. 
1) Start up the client and broadcast a UDP datagram on a defined interval.
2) Listen for other packets
3) When another packet is heard, pull it into the list of the peers. 
    But, if the peer is already in the list, do nothing.
4) On disconnect, the client sends an exit message, letting the other 
    users know that they are no longer online; making it safe for the 
    client to disconnect
